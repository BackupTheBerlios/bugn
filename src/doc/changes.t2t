**Legend**
(-) deleted
(~) changed
(+) added

=8.3.0=

(~) Improved view arranging runtime.
(~) Fixed bug #18641: Freezing problem. In most cases, bug.n will no 
    longer hang when one of its managed windows hangs.
(~) Fixed bug: Sometimes cycling through the windows in a view would 
    get stuck on a particular window.
(~) Fixed bug: Activating a window on a non-active view on 
    a non-active monitor could cause both monitors to change views.
(~) Gap widths are now treated identically on both "tile" and "monocle"
    layouts.
(~) Fixed bug #18650: Unexpected monitor focus changes
(~) Fixed bug in 'Manager_setWindowMonitor(d)' and 
    'Manager_setViewMonitor(d)'
(~) Fixed bug, which prevented bug.n from Main_reload, if the number of 
    monitors changed.
(~) Fixed bug: Closing Bar_cmdGui and activating the next to last window.
(~) Fixed bug: Vertical position of Bar_cmdGui, if 
    Config_verticalBarPos=tray and the task bar is at the top of the 
    monitor.
(~) Fixed bug: On Main_reload() and Config_verticalBarPos=tray.
(~) Changed the command line argument from specifying 'the path to the 
    config.ini' to 'the path to the general data directory containing 
    the config.ini and log.txt'.
(+) Multi-dimensional tiling of the master area. The user may now specify
    X and Y dimensions independently up to 9 x 9.
(+) Initially assign windows to the monitor on which they appear if 
    nothing is specified in the configuration.
(+) Created bug.n log to record major and debugging events and window 
    information.
(+) 'View margins' allowing a layout to occupy a limited space of the 
    monitor.
(+) 'Single window action', which allows to close or maximize windows 
    based on rules.
(+) 'Reload' hotkey, which reloads the whole script.
(+) Re-Setting the 'Reload' and 'ExitApp' hotkey in 'config.ini'-
(+) Added the configuration variable "Config_viewNames", with which views 
    can be named and the number of views can be set. The configuration 
    variable "Config_viewCount" therewith becomes obsolete.
(-) Removed the configuration variable "Config_viewCount".
(-) Removed the explicit listing of commands in the Bar_cmdGui.
(-) Removed the default rules for Gimp, since from version 2.8 onwards 
    Gimp can use a single application window instead of three and more.


=8.2.1=

(+) feature #005446: Reload function (reloading bug.n without changing
    the current association of windows to views/tags)
(+) workaround bug #018364: (Evernote: new note) Introducing the
    configuration variable "Config_onActiveHiddenWnds" to set the
    behaviour of bug.n for already existing but hidden windows on redraw
(+) Update of the Manager_getWindow*-functions to allow copying of the
    text to the clipboard.
(~) fixed bug #18356: Missing bar elements on Windows XP. (calculation
    of the element width depending on the font size)
(~) fixed bug: Support for saving another AutoHotkeyGUI as the active
    window of a view.
(~) fixed bug #018431: Immediate run-time errors running bug.n built
    from source with AutoHotkey_L version 1.1.05.03 onwards
(~) debugging related to AutoHotkey_L and 32-/64-Bit-Windows
